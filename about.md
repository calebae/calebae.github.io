Hi! I am a first year PhD student in [Biostatistics department at University of Pennsylvania](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/). I received [bachelor's degree](https://www.skku.edu/eng/About/media/news.do?mode=view&articleNo=51850&article.offset=0&articleLimit=10&srSearchVal=graduation) at [Sungkyunkwan University](skku.edu) with a focus on Mathematics and Global Business. I received master's degree at [Harvard University](harvard.edu) with a focus on Biostatistics. I served two years in Republic of Korea Marine Corps. I am a huge fan of Celtics, Red sox and Pats (Life is good if you're a New England franchise fan!).
