BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are pathologic that those mutations increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer. I have been working with [BayesMendel](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/bayesmendel/home) group to accurately estimate the magnitude of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation and recently we published [a paper](https://academic.oup.com/jncics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jncics/pkaa029/5824305) that estimates the risk of breast and ovarian cancer who has BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.
